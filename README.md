## üîç TypeScript Setup

This project uses TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience. Here's how to get started with TypeScript:

### TypeScript Configuration

The project comes with a pre-configured `tsconfig.json` file. If you need to customize it, refer to the [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

### Note

While installing dependencies, you must install it in the following form:

- npm install <package_name>
- npm install --save-dev @types/<package_name>

One for running the compiled js code and another for the typescript code to use the type definitions of the package.

### Compiling TypeScript

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

This will compile TypeScript files into JavaScript in the `dist/` directory and runs the compiled js code.
